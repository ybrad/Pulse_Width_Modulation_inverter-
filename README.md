# Pulse_Width_Modulation_inverter-
Supplied is a final PDF report of the Pulse Width Modulation Inverter project.  Within the annotated pdf are the Simulink block diagram used for the initial and
final design as well as component values, oscilloscope images of control signals and produced outputs, .  Removed were names, code from Arduino Microcontroller, and design equations.  Final design was able to run on Arduino Due
itself without the assitance of function generators used for design purposes.  

Images of control signals and produced outputs are in the PDF report on pages 6-16.
